## Chapter 1 Measure theory

### 1.1 Preliminaries

*(Lemma 1.1 and 1.2)* Rectangles: Additivity and subadditivity

*(Thm 1.3)* Every open set of R can be written as countable union of disjoint open intervals

*(Thm 1.4)* Every open set of R^d can be written as countable union of almost disjoint cubes

### 1.2 Exterior measure (Properties)

1. Monotonicity
2. Countable subadditivity
3. $m^*(E) =\inf m^*(O)$ where $O$ open
4. Additivity when the $d(E_1,E_2)>0$
5. Countable additivity for almost disjoint cubes

### 1.3 Measurable sets and Lebesgue measure

1. Open sets are measurable
2. Zero measurable
3. Countable union of measurable is measurable
4. Closed sets are measurable
5. Complement of measurable is measurable
6. Countable intersection of measurable is measurable

*(Thm 3.2)* Disjoint additivity

*(Cor 3.3)* Measurable Ek 1) $E_k \uparrow E \Rightarrow m(E)=\lim m(E_N)$ 2) $E_k \downarrow E, m(E_k)<\infty \Rightarrow m(E)=\lim m(E_N)$

*(Thm 3.4)* Measurable E

- Open O contains E s.t $m(Q-E)<\epsilon$
- closed F in E s.t. $m(E-F)<\epsilon$
- If m(E) finite, compact K in E s.t. $m(E-K)<\epsilon$
- If m(E) finite, finite union of cubes s.t $m(E \Delta F) < \epsilon$

$G_\delta$: intersections of open sets. $F_\sigma$: union of closed sets

*(Cor 3.5)* measurable iff diff from $G_\delta$ and $F_\sigma$ by measure zero

### 1.4 Measurable functions (Properties)

1. $f^{-1}(O)$ and $f^{-1}(F)$ are measurable

2. cont. ⇒ measurable. f measurable and finite, cont transformation is measurable

* Note: continuous function can map measurable set to non-measurable set. Consider Cantor function map to non measurable set. (See Ex. 21)

3. sup inf limsup liminf measurable

4. lim measurable

5. power, sum and product measurable

6. f=g a.e ⇒ g measurable

*(Thm 4.1)* non negative measurable function has a sequence of increasing simple function approximation

​	Proof: truncation F_N and slice into E's and define simple function

*(Thm 4.2)* general measurable function has a sequence of absolute increasing simple function approximation

*(Thm 4.3)* measurable function has a sequence of step function approximation for a.e. x

(Egorov) measurable function support with finite measure, for every $\epsilon$, can find a closed set $A_\epsilon$ in E, $m(E-A_\epsilon)< \epsilon$ and $f_k→f$ uniformly

(Lusin) measurable and finite function on E with finite measure, for every e, can find a closed set F in E, and $m(E-F_\epsilon)<\epsilon$ and $f|_{F_\epsilon}$ is continuous.

### Cantor set

#### Regular Cantor set

Tenary expansion representation: $x=\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k 3^{-k}$, where $a_k=0,2$. 
Cantor-Lebesgue function: $F(x)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k 2^{-k}$, where $b_k=a_k/2$. It is continous and monotone on x. 

#### Cantor sets of constant dissection

cut $\xi\in (0,1)$ instead of 1/3. $m(C_\xi)=0$. 

#### Cantor-like sets

Small enough such that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^{k-1}l_k<1$. $m(\hat C)>0$. It is perfect, without any open interval, and uncountable. 

## Chapter 2 Integration theory

### 1.1 The Lebesgue integral

Lebesgue integral $\int f(x)dx=\lim \int \varphi_n(x)dx$

*(BCT)* a sequence of measurable function bounded and on finite measure, converges a.e. x. Then f is measurble, bounded, supported on E for a.e. x, and $\int |f_n-f|\rightarrow 0$

#### On non negative functions

Integral of non negative measurable function :

1. Linearity
2. Additivity
3. Monotonicity
4. If g integrable and f bounded by g, f integrable
5. If f integrable, $f<\infty$ a.e. x
6. If $\int f=0$, then f(x)=0 a.e. x

*(Fatou's lemma)* a sequence of nonnegative functions f_n converges to f a.e. x, then $\int f \leq \liminf \int f_n$. 

*(Cor 1.8)* If $f_n \leq f$, then equality holds

*(MCT)* $f_n\uparrow f\Rightarrow \lim \int f_n=\int f$

*(Cor 1.10)* $\int \sum a_k(x)dx=\sum\int a_k(x)dx$. If $\sum \int a_k(x)dx$ is finite, then $\sum a_k(x)$ converges a.e. x.

#### General case

(DCT) $|f_n(x)|\leq g(x)$, which is integrable, then $\int|f-f_n|\rightarrow 0$. 

* This is stronger than $\int f_n\rightarrow \int f$, but we can prove they are equivalent if $f_n\rightarrow f$ a.e. by applying Fatou's Lemma to $|f|+|f_n|-|f_n-f|$. 

### 2.2 The space of L1 

*(Riesz-Fischer)* The L1 space is complete

​	Proof: take a subsequene and prove it is convergent to a f, which is defined by a infinite series. 

*(Cor)* If f_n is convergent in L1, then there is a subsequence that convergence to f a.e. x

*(Thm 2.4)* The step function, simple function, and continuous function are dense in L1 

### 2.3 Fubini 

*(Fubini)* f(x,y) integrable. For a.e. y

1. The slice $f^y$ is integrable
2. $\int f^y(x) dx$ is integrable
3. $\int (\int f(x,y)dy)dx=\int f$

*(Tonelli)* f(x,y) non-negative measurable function. For a.e. y

1. The slice $f^y$ is measurable
2. $\int f^y(x) dx$ is measurable
3. $\int (\int f(x,y)dy)dx=\int f$ in the extended sense

*(Cor 3.3)* For a.e. y, $E^y$ is a measurable set of $\mathbb R^{d_2}$. Since E^y can be non measurable for y of measure zero. 

=> $E_1 \times E_2$ measurable, if $ m_*(E_2)>0$, then $E_1$ measurable. 

(Prop 3.6) m(E)=m(E_1)m(E_2)  

*(Cor 3.7)* $\tilde f(x,y)=f(x)$ is measurable

*(Cor 3.8)* subgraph is measurable iff the function is measurable. 

* Proof: take $F(x,y)=y-f(x)$, and $\mathcal A =\{y\geq 0 \}\cap\{F\leq0\}$

*(Prop 3.9)*  $\tilde f(x,y)=f(x-y)$ is measurable

### Convolution

$(f*g)(x)=\int_{\mathbb R^d} f(x-y)g(y)dy$, see Ex 21

* If f and g are integrable, then convolution is integrable
* $||f*g||_{L^1}\leq ||f||_{L^1}||g||_{L^1}$

$f*g$ is uniformly continuous when f is integrable and g bounded. (Proof: use $||f_h-f||_{L^1}\rightarrow 0$, see Ex 24)

$f*g(x)\rightarrow 0$ as $|x|\rightarrow \infty$ (If f uniformly continuous and integrable, it holds, and prove by contradiction, see Ex 6)

Note $h(x)=m(E\cap x+E)$ can be written as a convolution. $h(x)=\int \chi_E(y-x)\chi_E(x) dy$. Hence we have $h(x)\rightarrow 0$ as $|x|\rightarrow \infty$

## Chapter 3 Differentiation and Integration

### 3.1 Differentiation of the integral

$$f^*(x)=\sup_{x\in B}\frac{1}{m(B)}\int_B |f(y)|dy \tag{Maximal function}$$

*(Thm 1.1)* If f integrable

1. f* is measurable
2. f*<$\infty$ for a.e. x
3. $m(\{x:f^*(x)>\alpha\})\leq \frac A \alpha ||f||_{L^1}$ where A can be 3^d

*(Lebesgue differentiation theorem)* If f is integrable, then $\lim \frac 1 {m(B)} \int_B f(y)dy=f(x)$ for a.e. x.

*(Thm 1.4)* If f is locally integrable, $\lim \frac 1 {m(B)} \int_B f(y)dy=f(x)$ for a.e. x.

* If we take f(x) to be char function of E, then it says $\lim \frac{m(B\cap E)}{m(B)}=1$ for a.e. x in E, or $m(B\cap E)\geq (1-\epsilon)m(B)$ for a.e. x in E

*Lebesgue density* of E: $\lim \frac{m(B\cap E)}{m(B)}=1$

*(Cor 1.5)* 1. Almost every x in E is a point of density of E 2. Almost every x not in E is not a point of density of E

*Lebesgue Set*: f(x) is finite and $\lim_B \int |f(y)-f(x)|dy=0$. 

*(Cor 1.6)* If f is locally integrable, then almost every point belongs to the Lebsgue set of f. 

*Shrink regularly*: $m(U_\alpha) \geq cm(B)$ for some c>0.
