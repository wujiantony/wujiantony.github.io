As some people may argue, the pandemic does not increase the rate of excretion, the demand for tissue should be unchanged. However, why is there still a panic buying in many cities over the whole country? This phenomenon may highly related to the customer behavior. 

One possible explaination is that toilet paper and water are common goods that are easy to remember and usually come with a whole pile. When the customers come to the grocery stores, these common goods are always on the top of the shopping list in the customers' minds. Due the limited memory of human being, these items are more likely to be picked compared to those uncommonly bought items, such as can openers or popcorns, even though the latter ones may still be needed during quarantine. 

Another explaination may be that customers behaviors are influenced by each other. Such behavior is called "herding". This can typically identified in the stock market where people usually buy/sell a stock followed the others. In the case of stockpiling, for example, the nearly empty toilet paper shelf may stimulate customers' willingness to buy. The relation of inventory level and customer behavior has also been studies in the OM community. 

Finally, the customer behavior is also driven by the customer's prediction of future demand. If s/he anticipate a shortage in the future, then s/he tends to buy more to keep cetain level of "safe stock". This behavior is refered as "holding".
